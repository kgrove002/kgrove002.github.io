                <p>Hello, my name is Kevin Grove. I am a technology enthusiast with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for creating innovative solutions. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wilmington University and currently work as a Realty Project Coach at Walmart. However, my goal is to transition into a full-time software development role.</p>  

                <p>I specialize in <strong>front-end development</strong> but have experience working across <strong>back-end and full-stack environments</strong>. My skill set includes <strong>Java, Python, React.js, SQL, and C++</strong>, and I am constantly expanding my knowledge to improve application usability and performance. In addition to software development, I have experience in <strong>data analytics and desktop computer repairs</strong>, making me a well-rounded problem solver.</p>  

                <p>Outside of work and studies, I actively engage in personal and collaborative projects, always seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Below is a list of my current goals.</p>  

        
                <table class="table table-bordered">

                      <td>Complete my degree with Wilmington University. </td>
                    </tr>

                      <td>2025-2027</td>
                      <td>Obtain a job within my degree's field. </td>
                    </tr>
